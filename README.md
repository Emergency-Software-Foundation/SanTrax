# SanTrax
An Open-Source Santa Tracker built with the Emergency Software Foundation's expertise in Geospatial Systems.

## Contributing
Please feel free to contribute to this project whether your already an ESF volunteer or you've never heard of us before.

~~In particular, we need help building out where Santa will visit each year, especially expanding into other countries.
To contribute in this regard, please PR counties.csv with the coordinates you believe should be visited. In the U.S. we have Santa visiting the geographic centers of each county, so for consistancy, we encourage you to find similar locations in your countries.
As for the format of this data, we are taking in point data in lat, lon format with each point on it's own line. Order of the points does not matter as the routing algorithm will decide its own order for the points when we build the routes.~~

~~Want a cool thing for your kids? If you host your own instance of SanTrax you can add your own house to the dataset so that your kids can see for certain that Santa was there, HOWEVER, for reasons pertaining to your privacy, we STRONGLY DISCOURAGE you from doing this in the official dataset here.~~
